## lab4: Interpreter

*This is a two-week lab with 200 points. A 5% bonus(10 points) is granted for those who complete this lab in one week. You can contact Shuyu Wu(wushuyu2002@sjtu.edu.cn) if you find anything wrong in this lab.*

### 1. background and object

An **interpreter** is a computer program that directly executes instructions written in a programming or scripting language. For example, matlab is executed through an interpreter.

Comparing with compiler, which turns a program into an executable binary file(for example, .exe on windows), interpreter does not generate binary file directly.

generally speaking, *Compiling principle* is an advanced CS course for undergraduate students. In this lab, we only require you to implement a very simple matlab interpreter, which can calculate the value of expressions, store variables and print out formatted output similar to `fprintf` in matlab.

Your object is to read commands from a txt file, and you need to parse these commands and output the results line by line.

### 2. Syntax

Input: a txt file named "commands.txt"

Output: stdout (i.e., output to the screen with `printf`).

**1. basic operators**

"+", "-", "*", "/", "^","()" with the meaning identical to matlab.

Notice that "^" in C is not the meaning of power. You may use pow() in math.h

The output can all be "double" type

example:

input(in commands.txt):

```matlab
2+ 8
6*(2 +9* 5/1.6)
2^4.6/(3*6)
-3.2+8
```

stdout:

```
10.000000
180.750000
1.347304
4.80000
```

Notice that you need to consider possible space between operator and numbers.

You can use **Reverse Polish expression** and **stack** to parse the expression, which will be covered in part 4 in this file.

**2. variables and assignments operator("=")**

You need to implement a variable system that can store and use variables in the expressions.

example:

input(in commands.txt):

```matlab
a=2.1
b=a^(6+2.8)
cx=a+b^0.9
cx=cx+1
```



stdout:

```
2.100000
684.746457
358.532104
359.532104
```



**3. formatted output**

You need to implement `fprintf` which is similar to fprintf in matlab.

input(in commands.txt):

```matlab
a=2.1
b=a^(6+2.8)
cx=a+b^0.9
cx=cx+1
fprintf("Hello, world!\n")
fprintf("cx+4=%f\n",  cx+4 )
```



stdout:

```
2.100000
684.746457
358.532104
359.532104
Hello, world!
cx+4=363.532104
```



**4. semicolon requirement**

Similar to matlab, if an expression has ";" at the end, there will be no output to the screen.

For fprintf, the ";" has no influence on the result

input:

```matlab
a=2.1;
b=a^(6+2.8);
cx=a+b^0.9;
cx=cx+1;
fprintf("Hello, world!\n");
fprintf("cx+4=%f\n",  cx+4 );
```

stdout:

```
Hello, world!
cx+4=363.532104
```



### 3. restrictions

To make your life easier, we make some restrictions.

1. We promise that there won't be syntax error in the testcase, so you can suppose all the commands in "commands.txt" are valid.
2. In expressions, you needn't consider multiple "^" case. For example, 4^5^6 actually means 4^(5^6) in mathematics, but you needn't consider this case. We won't have testcase like this.
3. Each line of command will consist of less then 100 characters, which means you can use char[120] to store one line of command.
4. There will be at most 20 variables, and a variable's length is at most 10.
5. About fprintf: 
   1. the syntax is: `fprintf("[string]")` or `fprintf("[string with 1 %f]", expression)`. That means there will be at most 1 "%f" in the string. Also, there won't be "%d" in the string;
   2. there may be '\n' in the string. You need to output newline. But there won't be other escape character like '\r';



### 4. Reverse Polish expression

â€‹	To deal with complex computational commands with multiple operators including parentheses, here
we can use a useful method: convert the expression to reverse polish expression first, then calculate
the reverse polish expression. Before asking what's reverse polish expression, you need to know something about stack.

#### 4.1 stack

"Stack" is a data structure which store some data. Unlike array which allows you to get and modify value at any place, stack only support two basic operations:

1. Push: Add a new element to the end of the stack
2. Pop: remove the element at the end of the stack

You can simply use an array(with enough space) and an index number(int) to implement a stack. The index number indicates the top+1 of the stack.

The way to initialize an empty stack(which store elements with "double" type) is:

```c
double stack[120]={0.0};
int top=0;//"top" indicates the top+1 of the stack
```

The way to push an element(for example, 4.5) to the stack is:

```c
stack[top++]=4.5;
```

explain: 4.5 is the variable that we want to push into the stack. since stack[top] isn't occupied by any data, we can simple assign 4.5 to stack[top]. Then we need to make top=top+1 because now there's one more element in the stack. We can put these two sentence together, and that's `stack[top++]=4.5;`

The way to pop element from the stack is:

```c
element=stack[--top];//suppose variable "element" has already been declared
```

explain: by making top=top-1, we have actually already pop out the last element. If we want to know what we have popped out, we need to have `element=stack[top-1];` before making "top" smaller. We can put these two sentence together, and that's `element=stack[--top];`

#### 4.2 Reverse Polish expression

Reverse Polish expression, also known as postfix expression, can help us deal with an expression.

"1+4" is a so-called "Infix expression", which means the operator "+" is at the middle of two corresponding operands. This kind of expression is not friendly to computer because of operator's priority issues. For example, in infix expression "1+(1+4)*(5+7)", as a human being you know how to calculate it in the correct order, but you have no idea how to write programme to make computer know the right order.

"postfix expression", however, make computer's life easier. It means to put two operands at the beginning, and put the operator at the end of the two operands. In this way, you'll find it easier to calculate its value.

For example, there's an expression "1+4", the reverse polish expression is "1, 4, +".

For expression "(1+4)*(5+7)", the reverse polish expression is "1, 4, +, 5, 7, +, *".

#### 4.3 turn Infix expression to Reverse Polish expression

How to turn normal infix expression into reverse polish expression? That's the hardest part. However, we can use stack and a set of rules to complete this task.

Follow the rules for an infix expression, and what you print is the reverse polish expression. You need a stack(initially it's empty) to help you.
a. Print out operands(i.e, numbers) as they arrive.
b. If the stack is empty or contains a left parenthesis on top, push the incoming operator onto
the stack.
c. If the incoming symbol is a left parenthesis, push it on the stack.
d. If the incoming symbol is a right parenthesis, pop the stack and print the operators until
you see a left parenthesis. Discard the pair of parentheses.
e. If the incoming symbol has higher precedence than the top of the stack, push it on the stack.(higher precedence means:  "^" > "*" = "/" > "+" = "-" )
f. If the incoming symbol has equal precedence with the top of the stack, use association. If
the association is left to right, pop and print the top of the stack and then push the incoming
operator. If the association is right to left, push the incoming operator. In our lab, all the operators are left to right, so you only need to "pop and print the top of the stack and then push the incoming
operator" when dealing with this situation.
g. If the incoming symbol has lower precedence than the symbol on the top of the stack, pop
the stack and print the top operator. Then test the incoming operator against the new top of
stack.(do rule e-g to them again).
h. At the end of the expression, pop and print all operators on the stack. (No parentheses
should remain)  

Now what you print is a reverse polish expression.

Please notice that "**print**" here means store something for further use because our journey doesn't end here. We need the reverse polish expression to calculate the value.

Let's see an example for (1+4)*(5+7) step by step:

remain: (1+4)*(5+7)

stack:

print:



remain: 1+4)*(5+7)

stack:(

print:



remain: +4)*(5+7)

stack:(

print: 1



remain: 4)*(5+7)

stack: (, +               // by rule b

print: 1





remain: )*(5+7)

stack: (, +

print: 1, 4



remain: *(5+7)

stack:                     // by rule d

print: 1, 4, +



remain: (5+7)

stack: *                  // by rule b

print: 1, 4, +



remain: 5+7)

stack: *, (

print: 1, 4, +



remain: +7)

stack: *, (

print: 1, 4, +, 5



remain: 7)

stack: *, (, +

print: 1, 4, +, 5



remain: )

stack: *, (, +

print: 1, 4, +, 5, 7



remain: 

stack: 

print: 1, 4, +, 5, 7, +, *                     // by rule d



" 1, 4, +, 5, 7, +, * " is the reverse polish expression.

### 4.4 calculate the Reverse Polish expression

The final step is to calculate the expression and get the result. This is not hard.

Take " 1, 4, +, 5, 7, +, * " as an example. We can still use a stack and follow these 2 rules:

a. If you get an operand, push it into a stack.

b. If you get an operator, pop two operands from the stack, calculate the result with respect to the operator, and push the result back into the stack.

At the end of the reverse polish expression, only one element remains in the stack. This is exactly the result.



### 5. General tips

**1. how to store the reverse polish expression**

You may think it's hard to store a reverse polish expression like "1.3, 4.5, +, 3.1, 6, -, /". You won't store it in a C-style string because you will find it hard to calculate its result. So, the only feasible way is to store it in a double array `double[]`.

So, how to store operators like '+'? One way is to store its ASCII, for '+', its ASCII is 43. However, it will confuse with a number 43. But you can use an auxiliary array to mark out whether the element represents a number or an operator's ASCII. 

This is an example for how it works:

```c
double RVP[120]={1.3,4.5,'+',3.1,6,'-','/'};
int helper[120]={1,1,2,1,1,2,2};//0 means not occupied, 1 means double, 2 means char
```

When print the reverse polish expression into array RVP in the 4.3, you also need to update the corresponding place at helper array, to 1(if it's an operand) or 2(if it's an operator)

Then when you need to operate on one of the element in the array RVP, for example, RVP[5], you also need to check helper[5] to determine if it's an operator or an operand.

**2. how to store the variables**

Since there will be at most 20 variables, you can use `char vars[20][15]={{'0'}};` to store all the variable names. use `int varnums=0;` to store the total numbers of the variables, and `double varvalue[20];` to store the value of the variables.

5. (bonus) Finish the lab in one week: 5% bonus(10 pts).



### 7. Reminders

I understand that this lab is very hard. However, your hard work will be paid off after the lab. Your understand towards C-style string, memory allocation and pointer will be enhanced if you keep thinking, searching on the internet, and debugging. Of course, you need to start early.

You're recommended to write some string-related functions to help you, for example, insert a string into another string, because you may perform these operations a lot. In this way, your codes can be shorter.

It's likely that you'll make some mistake in this lab. So, you need to know how to debug. You shouldn't write all your codes and run all of them afterwards. In this case, you'll find your codes not working and you don't know what's the mistake. Instead, you should debug module-by-module. For example, when you finish the part of transforming reverse polish expression, you can output them to the screen and see if they meet your expectation. Then you can go on to work on the next part.

After the lab, you need to compress all the .c and .h(if you have) files for lab4 into a single zip file in the name format: lab4-[Your Last Name]-[Your First Name]-[Your SJTU ID].zip. For example, lab4-Wu-Shuyu-520370910097.zip . You shouldn't have anything else in the zip other then .c and .h files.
